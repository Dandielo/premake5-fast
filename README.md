# Premake5-fastbuild
A premake5 module for generation of fastbuild projects. 

## Disclaimer
This module is not stable, and is under heavy development. You can try to use it but I don't guarantee any success atm. 

## How to use it
To make use of it, copy all files into a directory and require all files from the premake5-system.lua script file. 

It should work on Windows machines with the vs2017 toolset installed (v141). 

You can make use of the `fb-vstudio` command line argument to generate additional VCXProject and VCSolution function calls and generate VisualStudio projects with fastbuild support. 

## Contribute 
Any help is welcome!
Right now there are no official guides, but any pull request should at least try to improve the codebase!
