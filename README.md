# Premake5-fastbuild
A premake5 module for generation of fastbuild projects. 

## Disclaimer
This module is not stable, and is under heavy development. You can try to use it but it might need a bit more work for some cases. 

## Installation 

A detailed installation guide can be found [here](https://github.com/Dandielo/premake5-fastbuild/wiki/Installation).

### Additional remarks
So far this module works only with msc compilers because argument's are still hardcoded with this syntax.

### Command line options 
All additional premake5 command line options available with this module can be found [here](https://github.com/Dandielo/premake5-fastbuild/wiki/command-line-options). 

## Contribute 
Any help is welcome!
Right now there are no official guides, but any pull request should at least try to improve the codebase!
